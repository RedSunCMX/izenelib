The files under this directory show how IndexManager is used, but they can not be compiled directly
because IndexManager can not work without LA.
t_Indexer shows the whole process from parsing data in XML(which is charged by ScdParser) to index building.
t_agent is the server when IndexManager is configured to flush index remotedly, in that case, t_agent serves as the server, and t_Indexer servers as the client

An example configuration file is shown in sf1-index-manager.xml, and it is read by XmlConfigParser
