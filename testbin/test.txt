he
the

seem
to
be
expanding

this
is

the

in

exports
and
a
very
moderate

positive

domestic

growth
will
be
due

he
asked

these

were

from

the

late

said
preliminary
figures
showed
that
state
budget
deficit
rose
to
a
preliminary
47
billion
forints
last
year
from
billion
in
1985
and
billion
in
the
economy
overshot
a
target
deficit
of
23
billion
forints
because
of
poor
performance
by
state
which
needed
subsidies

tax
incentives
to
export

earn
hard
the

extent
and
nature
of

are
still
under

the
largest

item
must
definitely

including

exceeded
the

to
reach

in
up
from

in

approved

subsidies
of
170
billion
think
that
in
1987
it
is
quite
impossible
to
keep
up
the
former
situation
and
we
will
be
obliged
to
reduce

be
if
we
are

hard
then
we
will
not

boesze
said
firms
will
suffer
severe
tax
penalties
if
they
award

boesze
said
pure
economic

would
dictate
significant

in

that
social

made
this

ultimately

says
luigi
one
of

and

at

according
to
these
violent
swings
of
mood
have
been
occurring

that

particularly
the

is
still

of

itself
has
made
it
clear
it
is
not
happy
with
what
it
feels
to
be
its
status
among
the
major
industrialised
only
this
it
angrily
demanded
clarification
of
this
status
after
being
excluded
from
a
meeting
of
finance
ministers
from
the
group
of
five
comprising
the
united
west
france
and
italy
said
its
exclusion
from
the
meeting
violated
an
agreement
reached
in
tokyo
last
year
to
let
italy
and
canada
attend
meetings
held
by
the
five
whenever
discussions
concerned
managing
the
international
monetary
but
italy
needs
first
to
tackle
some
fundamental
problems
still
facing
its
economists
and
industrialists
must
not
forget
that
ours
is
still
a
vulnerable
warns
fiat
managing
director
cesare
he
says
that
while
recent
achievements
are
indeed
cause
for
satisfaction
and
the
focus
now
should
be
on
the
problems
still
remaining
rather
than
those
already
the
huge
state
sector
high
unemployment
and
a
heavy
dependence
on
imported
oil
are
among
the
most
worrying
experts
the
size
of
the
state
spending
deficit
estimated
at
billion
lire
in
1986
and
targetted
at
billion
lire
this
year
means
there
is
a
risk
inflation
could
spiral
says
carlo
head
of
the
private
luiss
university
in
inflation
fell
into
single
digits
for
the
first
time
in
a
decade
in
september
1984
and
by
january
this
year
was
running
at
but
it
is
still
not
low
enough
to
guarantee
international
economists
and
industrialists
and
unemployment
was
running
at
pct
nationally
last
october
according
to
the
latest
official
recent
official
data
showed
that
of
a
total
million
people
seeking
work
in
october
almost
73
pct
were
aged
between
14
and
unemployment
in
the
south
was
running
at
more
than
double
that
in
the
industrial
the
organisation
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
recently
forecast
that
italian
gross
domestic
product
would
rise
rise
three
pct
in
1987
after
expanding
pct
in
but
it
warned
that
growth
was
unlikely
to
be
enough
to
check
rising
another
problem
is
reliance
on
imported
raw
the
country
imports
around
80
pct
of
its
fuel
this
factor
actually
worked
sharply
in
favour
last
when
lower
energy
costs
helped
slash
the
trade
deficit
to
billion
lire
by
year
end
from
billion
lire
in
but
economists
say
the
improvement
owes
little
to
any
structural
change
in
the
italian
economy
and
that
any
reversal
of
the
trend
in
costs
could
have
serious
if
italy
truly
wants
to
be
counted
among
the
top
industrialised
it
also
needs
to
tighten
up
stockmarket
operating
procedures
and
encourage
firms
to
supply
more
quality
information
about
their
economists
italy
has
no
controls
on
insider
the
country
also
needs
to
shed
its
rigid
capital
movements
controls
a
european
community
directive
calls
for
these
to
be
dismantled
by
1992
but
this
too
will
require
a
less
blinkered
attitude
and
a
change
in
traditional
operating
economists
if
i
wanted
to
invest
in
