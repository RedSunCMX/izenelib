// *************** Performance timers ************************
// What do you really want from a performance timer:
//  (1) Can determine actual time of day from the performance time.
//  (2) Time goes forward, never backward.
//  (3) Same time on different processors (or even different machines).
//  (4) Time goes forward at a constant rate (doesn't get faster and slower)
//  (5) Portable.
//  (6) Getting the time is cheap.
// Unfortuately it seems tough to get Properties 1-5.  So we go for Property 6,, but we abstract it.
// We offer a type tokutime_t which can hold the time.
// This type can be subtracted to get a time difference.
// We can get the present time cheaply.
// We can convert this type to seconds (but that can be expensive).
// The implementation is to use RDTSC (hence we lose property 3: not portable).
// Recent machines have constant_tsc in which case we get property (4).
// Recent OSs on recent machines (that have RDTSCP) fix the per-processor clock skew, so we get property (3).
// We get property 2 with RDTSC (as long as there's not any skew).
// We don't even try to get propety 1, since we don't need it.
// The decision here is that these times are really accurate only on modern machines with modern OSs.
typedef uint64_t tokutime_t;             // Time type used in by tokutek timers.

// The value of tokutime_t is not specified here. 
// It might be microseconds since 1/1/1970 (if gettimeofday() is
// used), or clock cycles since boot (if rdtsc is used).  Or something
// else.
// Two tokutime_t values can be subtracted to get a time difference.
// Use tokutime_to_seconds to that convert difference  to seconds.
// We want get_tokutime() to be fast, but don't care so much about tokutime_to_seconds();
//
// For accurate time calculations do the subtraction in the right order:
//   Right:  tokutime_to_seconds(t1-t2);
//   Wrong   tokutime_to_seconds(t1)-toku_time_to_seconds(t2);
// Doing it the wrong way is likely to result in loss of precision.
// A double can hold numbers up to about 53 bits.  RDTSC which uses about 33 bits every second, so that leaves
// 2^20 seconds from booting (about 2 weeks) before the RDTSC value cannot be represented accurately as a double.
//

// Get tokutime.  We want this to be fast, so we expose the implementation as RDTSC.
